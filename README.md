## Design patterns
* Single tab
* No var
* Search functionality

## Micro libraries 
* Routie for routes


### Wishlist
* Using a templating engine (transparancy)

### Backlog
* Make routie in a router module (is now in the render module)
* Use Filter,map, reduce. 
* Promise doenst work in the github demo
