## Demo for map, filter, reduce.

The downsize from the api there is not really something to filter the data (for example a tag). In the Codepen demo i made a array with tags included to show waht filter can do. 

Demo https://codepen.io/thekevster-nl/pen/ExVRazo


### Limits:
* Rate limit: unknown

## Collection Records

## Design patterns
* Single tab
* No var
* Search functionality

## Micro libraries 
* Routie for routes

## To do List
- [x] Use a new API
- [x] Make modules
- [x] Use routie
- [x] Make a detail page
- [x] Search function
- [x] Styling
- [x] Add loading state
- [x] use map
- [x] creat demo for map,filter and reduce
- [ ] split API and Search API in there own file



### Wishlist
* Using a templating engine (transparancy)
